# OCR_Project
### OCR: Optical Character Recognition.
An OCR program extracts and repurposes data from scanned documents, camera images and image-only pdfs.

OCR employs two main algorithms for character recognition: pattern recognition and feature detection.

- In **pattern recognition**, the OCR program is trained with examples of text in different fonts and formats to compare and recognize characters in the scanned document.
- Feature detection, on the other hand, applies rules based on specific features of a letter or number, such as the number of lines, curves, or intersections.

OCR as a process generally consists of several sub-processes to perform as accurately as possible. The subprocesses are:

- Preprocessing of the Image
- Text Localization
- Character Segmentation
- Character Recognition
- Post Processing

In this project, we will try OCR with different python libraries and evaluate each one's preformance:
1. **Tesseract**: an open-source OCR engine that has gained popularity among OCR developers. Tesseract began as a Ph.D. research project in HP Labs, Bristol. It gained popularity and was developed by HP between 1984 and 1994. In 2005 HP released Tesseract as an open-source software. Since 2006 it is developed by *Google*. Tesseract is compatible with many programming languages and frameworks through wrappers(pytesseract).
2. **EasyOCR**: 
3.
